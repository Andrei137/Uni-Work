Part 1

Step 1
How many host addresses are available in a /25 network?
2^7 - 2 = 126

What is the total number of host addresses needed in the topology diagram?
80

How many subnets are needed in the network topology?
6

Step 2
What is the subnet description (e.g. BR1 LAN or BR1-BR2 link)?
BR1 LAN

How many IP addresses are required in the largest subnet?
40

What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
255.255.255.192

How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
62

Can you subnet the 192.168.33.128/25 network address to support this subnet?
Da

What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
192.168.33.128/26 si 192.168.33.192/26

Step 3
What is the subnet description?
BR2 LAN

How many IP addresses are required for the second largest subnet?
25

What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
255.255.255.224

How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
30

Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
Da

What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
192.168.33.192/27 si 192.168.33.224/27

Step 4
What is the subnet description?
BR2 IoT LAN

How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet?
5

What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
255.255.255.248

How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
6

Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
Da

What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
192.168.33.224/29, 192.168.33.232/29, 192.168.33.240/29, si 192.168.33.248/29

Step 5
What is the subnet description?
BR1-BR2 Link

How many IP addresses are required for the next largest subnet?
2

What subnet mask can support that many host addresses?
255.255.255.252

How many total host addresses can that subnet mask support?
2

Can you subnet the remaining subnet again and still support this subnet?
Da

What are the network addresses that would result from this subnetting?
192.168.33.248/30 si 192.168.33.252/30

Reflection Question
Can you think of a shortcut for calculating the network addresses of consecutive /30 subnets?
